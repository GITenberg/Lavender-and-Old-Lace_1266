description: "Lavender and Old Lace is a Victorian romance novel written by Myrtle\
  \ Reed and published in September 1902. It tells the story of some remarkable women,\
  \ each of whom has a unique experience with love. The book follows in Reedâ€™s long\
  \ history of inciting laughter and tears in her readers through provocative prose.\
  \ She was often witty in dialogue and dispensing in advice, while gingerly skirting\
  \ any moral issues.\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
